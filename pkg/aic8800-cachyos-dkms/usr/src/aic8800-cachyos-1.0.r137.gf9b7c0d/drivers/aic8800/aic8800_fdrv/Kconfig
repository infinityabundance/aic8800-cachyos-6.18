	help
	  This is the main driver for AIC8800 series USB Wi-Fi chips.
	  It supports IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax (Wi-Fi 6) and 2.4GHz/5GHz 
	  dual-band operation.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called aic8800_fdrv.

config AIC8800_HE_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) High Efficiency"
	default y
	help
	  Enables High Efficiency (HE) features for 802.11ax. 
	  This is required to achieve Wi-Fi 6 speeds. Turn this off 
	  only if you encounter compatibility issues with specific 
	  access points.

config AIC_BR_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable Bridge Extension (NAT25) Support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this if you intend to use the Wi-Fi interface as part 
	  of a Linux software bridge (e.g., for HostAPD hotspots or 
	  network repeaters). This enables the NAT25 L2-translation 
	  logic in aic_br_ext.c.

config AIC8800_FORCE_5G
	bool "Force enable 5GHz Band"
	default n
	help
	  Forces the driver to enable 5GHz channels regardless of 
	  initial regulatory domain data. Use this with caution.
