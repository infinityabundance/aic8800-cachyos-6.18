	  This option enables the firmware loading module required for 
	  AIC8800 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth initialization.

	  enables the command management and firmware loading 
	  logic defined in aicbluetooth_cmds.h/c.

	  enables the firmware loading module and the 
	  AICWFDBG diagnostic logging system.

	  enables the firmware loader and the high-performance 
	  RX pre-allocation memory system.

	  enables the firmware loading module. 
	  It includes high-performance RX buffer pre-allocation 
	  defined in aicwf_rx_prealloc.h.

	  firmware loader with TX/RX pre-allocation 
	  optimizations for better performance on Linux.

	  firmware loader with TX queue pre-allocation 
	  optimizations (aicwf_txq_prealloc.h).

	  USB-based firmware loader for AIC8800.
	  It handles device enumeration and power management.

	  USB-based firmware loader. 
	  It relies on the structures defined in aicwf_usb.h to 
	  manage communication with the hardware.

	  enables the firmware loader, including MD5-based 
	  integrity checking for firmware binaries.

	  If you are building this for CachyOS or standard Linux, say M here.
	  This will create the 'aic_load_fw.ko' module.
